# Twitch View Bot

__disclaimer:__ This project was created only for educational purpose and really fast. It probably has a lot of bugs and bad architecture.
However, the main goal is to show the way of sending requests which Twitch will count as a viewer.

### Description

### Installation
``git clone https://github.com/OGSegu/Twitch_ViewBot.git``  
``./gradlew build``
