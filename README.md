# Twitch View Bot

__disclaimer:__ This project was created only for educational purpose and really fast. It probably has a lot of bugs and bad architecture.
However, the main goal is to show the way of sending requests which Twitch will count as a viewer.

### Description
First open-source really working view bot for Twitch. My project don't use Selenium, it works only on HTTP requests.

### Installation
``git clone https://github.com/OGSegu/Twitch-View-Bot_Upgraded.git``  
``./gradlew build``


__Contributions are welcomed.__
